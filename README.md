# Web-application----Cloud-Storage-Dropbox-
In this project, I have developed a trivial photo-album application on Dropbox. It has a form to upload a new image (a *.jpg). A display window that lists the names of the images in your Dropbox directory. For each image name you have a link that, when you click it, it downloads and displays the image in the image section. Each image name also has a button to delete this image from the Dropbox storage.
An image section that displays the current image.
